# üìú Libre WebUI Community & Ethical Charter

_Adopted June 2025 ‚Ä¢ Maintained by Kroonen AI, Inc._

This charter establishes the foundational principles, governance model, and ethical guidelines that define Libre WebUI as a community-driven project.

---

## üéØ Mission

Libre WebUI exists to provide a **free, privacy‚Äërespecting, community‚Äëdriven interface** for local large‚Äëlanguage‚Äëmodel workflows.  
We pursue simplicity and user sovereignty above growth, hype, or outside investment.

## üåü Core Principles

| Principle               | Commitment                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Freedom**             | Source code will remain licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** in perpetuity.                                                     |
| **Privacy**             | **Zero telemetry**. No analytics, no tracking, no phone‚Äëhome code‚Äîever.                                                              |
| **Transparency**        | All decisions, road‚Äëmaps, and governance discussions occur in public issues/PRs or recorded community calls.                         |
| **Inclusive Community** | We enforce a strict anti‚Äëharassment policy. All contributors and users are welcome regardless of background, identity, or geography. |
| **Local‚ÄëFirst**         | The default experience never requires cloud services or external APIs. Remote options are opt‚Äëin and clearly marked.                 |
| **No Relicensing**      | This project shall **never** be relicensed to more restrictive terms (e.g., BSD‚Äë3 with CLA, dual‚Äëlicense, proprietary).              |
| **Ethical Funding**     | We accept donations or grants only if they do not impose control over roadmap, license, or community. **No VC equity.**              |

- Illustrate personality traits

### Testing and Iteration

**Systematic Testing:**
1. Start with diverse conversation types
2. Test edge cases and difficult questions
3. Evaluate consistency across sessions
4. Gather feedback from intended users

**Refinement Process:**
- Adjust parameters based on response quality
- Refine system prompts for better alignment
- Update descriptions for clarity
- Iterate based on real-world usage

### Performance Optimization

**Resource Management:**
- Use appropriate context windows for task complexity
- Balance creativity with computational efficiency
- Consider token limits for response length

**Model Selection:**
- Match model capabilities to persona requirements
- Use specialized models for domain expertise
- Consider response speed vs quality trade-offs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Inconsistent Personality:**
- Increase specificity in system prompt
- Lower temperature for more consistent responses
- Add examples of desired behavior

**Generic Responses:**
- Enhance system prompt with unique characteristics
- Increase temperature slightly for more personality
- Add specific domain knowledge

**Poor Context Retention:**
- Increase context window size
- Summarize important conversation points
- Use structured conversation templates

### Model Compatibility

**Different AI Models:**

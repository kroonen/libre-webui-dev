# 🤖 AI-Powered Development Analysis

This document describes the AI-enhanced development analysis and changelog generation system for Libre WebUI.

## 🎯 Overview

Libre WebUI now includes intelligent analysis tools that leverage your local Ollama installation to provide deeper insights into development progress, code changes, and project evolution. This system provides three main capabilities:

1. **AI-Enhanced Changelog Generation** - Smart release notes with contextual summaries
2. **Comprehensive Development Analysis** - Project health and technical insights  
3. **Automated Release Intelligence** - AI-powered release process enhancement

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Ollama running locally**: `ollama serve`
- **A suitable model installed**: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` (recommended for speed)
- **Git repository with commits**: The system analyzes your git history

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate AI-powered changelog for current changes
npm run changelog:ai

# Comprehensive development analysis
npm run analyze

# Quick metrics overview without AI
npm run analyze:quick

# AI analysis of development impact
npm run changelog:ai:impact
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Changelog Generation

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run changelog:ai` | User-focused release notes with AI insights |
| `npm run changelog:ai:summary` | Development overview and patterns |
| `npm run changelog:ai:impact` | Technical impact analysis |

### Development Analysis

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run analyze` | Full project analysis with AI insights |
| `npm run analyze:quick` | Fast metrics without AI processing |
| `npm run analyze:metrics` | Export raw metrics as JSON |

### Release Process

The standard release process (`npm run release`) now automatically includes AI-powered summaries when Ollama is available.

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Ollama server configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# AI model selection (smaller = faster, larger = more detailed)
CHANGELOG_AI_MODEL=llama3.2:3b        # For changelog generation
ANALYSIS_AI_MODEL=llama3.2:3b         # For development analysis

# Timeouts
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=30000                   # Standard operations (30s)
OLLAMA_LONG_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=900000  # Model loading (15min)
```

### Recommended Models

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Size | Speed | Quality |
|----------|------------------|------|-------|---------|
| **Fast changelog** | `llama3.2:1b` | ~1GB | ⚡ Fast | Good |
| **Balanced** | `llama3.2:3b` | ~2GB | 🚀 Medium | Very Good |
| **Detailed analysis** | `qwen2.5:7b` | ~4GB | 🐌 Slow | Excellent |

```bash
# Install recommended models
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b  # For detailed analysis
```

🧠 AI Development Analysis
============================

Project Health Score: 8.5/10

The Libre WebUI project shows strong development momentum with consistent 
commit activity (3.2 commits/day average) and a well-architected full-stack
TypeScript application. The codebase demonstrates mature patterns with 
proper separation of concerns between frontend/backend.

Technical Strengths:
- Modern tech stack (React + TypeScript + Express)
- Comprehensive Ollama API integration  
- Docker containerization with development/production configs
- Active release automation and changelog generation

Recommendations:
- Consider implementing automated testing coverage
- Monitor bundle size as artifact features expand
- Plan for horizontal scaling as user base grows
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis Prompts

You can modify the AI prompts in the script files to customize analysis focus:

```javascript
// In ai-changelog-generator.js
const customPrompt = `
Analyze these commits for a WebUI focused on accessibility improvements...
${commitText}
Focus on user experience and accessibility improvements.
`;
```

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action integration
- name: Generate AI Release Notes
  run: |
    ollama serve &
    sleep 10
    ollama pull llama3.2:3b
    npm run changelog:ai > release-notes.md
    
- name: Development Analysis
  run: |
    npm run analyze:metrics > metrics.json
    # Upload metrics for tracking
```

### Batch Analysis

```bash
# Analyze multiple releases
git tag -l | tail -5 | while read tag; do
  git checkout $tag
  echo "Analysis for $tag:" >> analysis.log
  npm run analyze:quick >> analysis.log
done
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Ollama not available"**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Start Ollama if needed
ollama serve

# Verify model is available
ollama list
```

**"AI generation timeout"**
```bash
# Use a smaller/faster model
export CHANGELOG_AI_MODEL=llama3.2:1b

# Or increase timeout
export OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=60000
```

**"Model not found"**
```bash
# Install the required model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Or use an available model
ollama list
export CHANGELOG_AI_MODEL=your-available-model
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use smaller models** for frequent operations (changelog generation)
2. **Keep Ollama warm** by running a test query periodically  
3. **Batch operations** when possible to avoid model loading overhead
4. **Monitor resource usage** especially with larger models

## 🌟 Best Practices

### For Teams
- **Standardize models** across the team for consistent output quality
- **Include AI summaries** in pull request descriptions
- **Run analysis** before major releases to identify potential issues
- **Track metrics over time** to monitor project health trends

### For Maintainers  
- **Regular analysis** to catch technical debt early
- **AI-generated release notes** save significant time
- **Metrics tracking** helps with project planning and resource allocation
- **Strategic insights** guide long-term technical decisions

### For Contributors

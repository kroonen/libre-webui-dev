# üöÄ Quick Start: Your First AI Chat in 5 Minutes

Welcome to Libre WebUI! This guide will get you chatting with AI in just a few minutes. No technical expertise required!

:::tip Complete Setup Time
**Total time: 5-10 minutes** including model download (depending on your internet speed)
:::

## üìã What You'll Need

- **A computer** with at least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- **Internet connection** (for initial setup only)
- **5-10 minutes** of your time

## üéØ Step 1: Install Ollama (The AI Engine)

Ollama is the engine that runs AI models on your computer. It's free and easy to install.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    
**Install Steps:**
1. Visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Click **"Download for Windows"**
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Ollama will start automatically

:::tip Windows Users
The installer will automatically add Ollama to your system PATH, so you can use it from any terminal.

Open a terminal and verify Ollama is installed:

```bash
ollama --version
```

:::success Expected Output
You should see a version number like `ollama version is 0.1.x`. If not, restart your computer and try again.

## ü§ñ Step 2: Download Your First AI Model

Think of AI models as different "brains" - each with unique capabilities. Let's start with a fast, friendly one:

### üåü Recommended Model

**Best for most users:**
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

**Size:** ~4GB | **Speed:** Fast | **Quality:** Excellent

- Current best single-GPU model
- Great balance of speed and intelligence
- Perfect for daily use

### ‚ö° Alternative Models

<details>
<summary><strong>Ultra Fast (for slower computers)</strong></summary>

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

**Size:** ~1GB | **Speed:** Ultra-fast | **Quality:** Good

- Smallest, fastest model
- Works on any computer
- Great for quick questions

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Powerhouse (for powerful hardware)</strong></summary>

```bash
ollama pull phi4:14b
```

**Size:** ~14GB | **Speed:** Good | **Quality:** Excellent

- Microsoft's compact powerhouse
- Requires 16GB+ RAM
- State-of-the-art performance

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>With Vision (for image analysis)</strong></summary>

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b
```

**Size:** ~3GB | **Speed:** Fast | **Quality:** Good

- Can understand images
- Upload photos and ask questions
- Perfect for visual tasks

</details>

:::info Download Progress
This will download several gigabytes of data. While it downloads:
- ‚òï Grab a coffee
- üìñ Read about what you can do with AI  
- üéµ Listen to some music

The download typically takes 5-15 minutes depending on your internet speed.
:::

## üåê Step 3: Start Libre WebUI

Now let's get the interface running. Since you already have Ollama installed from Step 1, we'll use Docker with external Ollama connection:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker-external" label="üê≥ Docker + External Ollama (Recommended)" default>

**Perfect for this setup since you already have Ollama installed:**

**Option A: Using pre-built image (fastest):**
```bash
# Clone the repository first
git clone https://github.com/libre-webui/libre-webui.git
cd libre-webui

# Use the external Ollama configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.external-ollama.yml up -d
```

**Option B: Build locally from source:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/libre-webui/libre-webui.git
cd libre-webui

# Build the local Docker image
docker build --no-cache -t libre-webui:latest .

# Run with external Ollama configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.external-ollama.yml up -d
```

**What this does:**
- Runs Libre WebUI in Docker
- Connects to your existing Ollama installation
- Maps port 8080 for web access
- Saves your data persistently

:::tip Why External Ollama?
Since you installed Ollama in Step 1, this setup:
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing Ollama installation
- ‚úÖ Avoids running duplicate Ollama instances
- ‚úÖ Better resource management
- ‚úÖ Easier to manage models with `ollama pull`
:::

:::note When to Build Locally
Choose local build when:
- You want the latest development features
- You've made custom modifications
- The pre-built image has compatibility issues
- You prefer building from source for security
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-simple" label="üê≥ Simple Docker (All-in-One)">

**If you want everything in Docker containers:**

```bash
# This includes both Libre WebUI AND Ollama in containers
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v libre-webui:/app/backend/data --name libre-webui --restart always ghcr.io/libre-webui/libre-webui:main
```

:::info When to Use This
Use this approach if:
- You want everything containerized
- You don't mind having Ollama in a container
- You prefer a single command setup
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="üî® From Source">

**For developers who want to modify the code:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/libre-webui/libre-webui.git
cd libre-webui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

:::note Development Only
This method is for developers contributing to the project.
:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### üîß Verify Ollama Connection

Before starting Libre WebUI, make sure your Ollama is running:

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# If not running, start it
ollama serve
```

## üéâ Step 4: Start Chatting!

1. **Open your browser** and go to:
   - **Docker External Ollama**: http://localhost:8080
   - **Simple Docker**: http://localhost:3000
   - **From Source**: http://localhost:5173
2. **You should see the Libre WebUI interface!**
3. **Click "New Chat"** or just start typing in the message box
4. **Type your first message** like "Hello! Can you introduce yourself?"
5. **Press Enter** and watch the AI respond in real-time!

:::tip Troubleshooting
If you don't see any models available, make sure:
- Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- You have a model downloaded: `ollama pull llama3.2`
- Check the [Docker External Ollama guide](./DOCKER_EXTERNAL_OLLAMA) for detailed troubleshooting
